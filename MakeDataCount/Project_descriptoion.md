### My thought process for the solution


 - [x] step - 1 - I have read all the PDFs and extractred them using `pymupdf` library. Saved each extracted data in a text file.
  - []step - 2a - I dentify the sections in the paper based on the definitions and keywods provided.
  - []step - 2b - as a imporved step I will use LLM to identify the sections in the paper.
  - []step - 2c - write a prompt to undertand at which sections the data citations are present.
